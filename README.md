# SVANE

Hello and Welcome, this is the SVANE SERVER repository. SVANE SERVER is part of [SVANE](https://github.com/JSulthoni/SVANE-frontend) fullstack M.E.R.N project ðŸš€ ðŸŒŸ

## Key Objectives
* Create a secure, scalable backend server by implementing modular pattern and protected route.
* Solve the problem of security issue by using cookie and signed credentials for access token.
* Sets independent backend server to makes it easier for scalability and maintainability.


## Features
* Security: Routes require API key and/or access token. Access origin is fixed using CORS.
* Reusability: The modular design allows for the reuse of components.
* Maintainability: The separation of concerns with routing makes it easier to test individual components.
* Scalability: MVC pattern promotes scalability by allowing backend and frontend to evolve independently.


## Technologies
SVANE SERVER utilise following technologies:

* ExpressJS: For building RESTful API and HTTP request.
* Mongoose: For database schema and query.
* MongoDB: For database storage.
* Node.js: For server-side scripting.
* Stripe: For creating product checkout session.
* JWT: For secure credentials by generating signed token.
